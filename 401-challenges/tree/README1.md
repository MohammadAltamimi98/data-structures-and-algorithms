# Code Challenge: Class 16

# Feature Tasks
- Write the following method for the Binary Tree class

       - find maximum value
       - Arguments: none
       - Returns: number

- Find the maximum value stored in the tree. You can assume that the values stored in the Binary Tree will be numeric.


## Visual example:

## Whiteboard solution:

## Approach and efficiency

- we define an array and put each node value in it.
- we loop through the array
- define a comparison variable to compare with . ex array[0]
- after it has looped through every index return the largest value

- since we used a for loop then:  
    * Time complexity : O(n)
