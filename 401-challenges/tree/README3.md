# Code Challenge: Class 18

## Challenge: 
- Conduct “FizzBuzz” on a k-ary tree while traversing through it to create a new tree.
<br/>

## Feature Tasks
- Write a function called fizz buzz tree
   - Arguments: k-ary tree
   - Return: new k-ary tree
   <br/>
   <br/>


- Determine whether or not the value of each node is divisible by 3, 5 or both. Create a new tree with the same structure as the original, but the values modified as follows:


     - If the value is divisible by 3, replace the value with “Fizz”
     - If the value is divisible by 5, replace the value with “Buzz”
     - If the value is divisible by 3 and 5, replace the value with “FizzBuzz”
     - If the value is not divisible by 3 or 5, simply turn the number into a String.
